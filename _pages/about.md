My name is Hongxiang Zhang (张鸿翔). I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree at UC Davis under the supervision of Prof. Hao Chen. My research interests include AI security, natural language processing (NLP), code generation, multimodal systems, and multi-agent interactions. I will be joining Prof. [Tianyi Zhang's group](https://tianyi-zhang.github.io/) in fall 2025.
