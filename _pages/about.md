Hola! My name is Hongxiang Zhang (张鸿翔), and I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree at UC Davis under the supervision of Prof. Hao Chen. My research interests include AI security, natural language processing (NLP), code generation, multimodal systems, and multi-agent interactions. I am eager to expand my research in these areas and am seeking a PhD position starting in Spring or Fall 2025.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy photography, traveling, and hiking, which allow me to explore new places and capture nature’s beauty. Music is a big part of my life, with David Tao being my all-time favorite artist, though I appreciate many genres. Checkout my photography works at instagram.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
